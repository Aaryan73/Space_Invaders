# Space_Invaders

This is one of the early games that I made using PyGame module. The code is completely and perfectly commented so that anyone can get it.

Note:
1. Before running the program on your computer make sure that you have installed PyGame library. To install Pygame library just type 'pip install pygame' in command prompt

Do play around with player, enemy and bullet speeds according to you preference and you can also manage the number of enemies.
